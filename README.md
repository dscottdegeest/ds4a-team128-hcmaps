Human Capital Map project for DS4A Team 128 

Since 2014, tech companies (e.g. Apple, Facebook, Microsoft etc.) have released diversity reports.
However, they have shown marginal progress towards increased hiring of underrepresented minorities (i.e. women, Black, Hispanic/Latinx). 
The lack of diversity in tech can be attributed to issues in the recruiting, hiring and retention of diverse candidates.
One of the primarily cited challenges in recruiting diverse talent is the inability to localize qualified workers. 
The geographic concentration of tech companies along the US coasts exacerbates this issue.
Recruiting efforts are often limited recruiting practices to those regions. 
An understanding of where talent can be sourced from outside current tech hubs will open new avenues for recruiting diverse talent. 

Outside of the current five centers of tech talent 
(Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, and San Diego), 
where can tech workers from underrepresented groups (i.e. women, Black, Hispanic) be sourced from within the United States?
